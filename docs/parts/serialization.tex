\label{serialization}

\texttt{chess\_backend} uses 2 main formats for serialization: PGN and binary-64.

\begin{description}
    \item[PGN] is a \href{http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm}{standard format} recognized by a bunch of tools out there.
    \item[binary-64] is a custom format designed to keep track of most while being very memory efficient.
